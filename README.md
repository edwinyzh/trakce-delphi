Trakce Delphi Interface
=======================

This repository contains delphi interface to Trakce libraries,
e.g. [XpressNET library](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/xn-lib-cpp-qt) or
[Simulator library](TODO).

It allows programmer to use these libraries and to dynamically switch between
them. It provides simple event-based interface via `TTrakceIFace` class defined
in `Trakce.pas`.

It is intended for projects benefiting from possibility of changing the library
on-line, e. g. [hJOPserver](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/hJOPserver).

Interface between dlls and this project is described on
[wiki](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/xn-lib-cpp-qt/wiki).
